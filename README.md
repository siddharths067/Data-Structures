# Data-Structures
A Collection of Data Structures Implementations all at a single place.
All the data-structures presented here are all focused on beginners unless
otherwise stated to be aimed at contest implementations.
I have tried to avoid macros wherever possible however contest implementations
might have some.

If any ambiguity creeps in because of contest macros it is advised to report
them to me.
